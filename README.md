# HTML5-Up Phantom template to an 11ty theme

I'm converting the free template https://html5up.net/phantom to work as an https://www.11ty.dev theme. 

Eleventy is a simple static site generator that uses JavaScript to render markdown files as a static HTML website. It's great for small websites and blogs.

### Progress
This is version 1.0 and is still being worked on. The about page is not functioning correctly. I'm having trouble getting the grid system to create two content colums one col-7 and the other col-5. But, I want them both col-12 on mobile, with the images stacking under the text.

I've experimented by replacing the grid system with flexbox, but it breaks the layout in other ways. 

### Goal
My goal is to use this template for my Graphic Design Studio website and blog.

### Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Open a terminal and run "npm install" this will setup your node modules.
3. Run the local server with "npm start". This will launch the website in a live server so you can see your changes as you make them.
4. Load the project folder in your favorite text editor. I use https://vscodium.com

Now you can edit the theme.
